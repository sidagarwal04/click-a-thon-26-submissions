"""
Daily vs hourly table selection.

Two tables, same conceptual schema, different time grain. Everything in this
module is config plus small SQL-fragment builders; the actual detection and
drill-down queries in clickhouse_queries.py take a `time_col` and `is_hourly`
argument rather than hardcoding 'date'.

WHAT I DO NOT KNOW AND YOU MUST VERIFY:
The hourly table's real column name and type. I have never seen its schema.
CLICKHOUSE_HOURLY_TIME_COL defaults to a guess ("hour"). If your table uses a
different name (`event_hour`, `ts`, `timestamp`, ...) or a different type
(DateTime vs DateTime64 vs a truncated date), set CLICKHOUSE_HOURLY_TIME_COL in
.env before switching the app to Hourly, or every query in this file will fail
with an "Unknown identifier" error identical in shape to the decomposition bug
from earlier - same root cause, wrong column name, different file.

# Seasonal-key SQL fragments

# Daily seasonality is "same weekday." Hourly seasonality is stronger and
# two-dimensional - intraday (night trough vs afternoon peak) AND weekly (the
# glossary's weekend effect still applies at hourly grain, layered on top of
# the daily cycle). A flat hourly baseline would flag every night as an
# incident the same way a flat daily baseline flagged every weekend.
#
# The seasonal key is what "same time as this window" means for a grain:
#   daily:  weekday only              -> toDayOfWeek(time_col)
#   hourly: (weekday, hour) pair      -> (toDayOfWeek(time_col), toHour(time_col))
