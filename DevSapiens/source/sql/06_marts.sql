-- Filter, then sum across whatever dims are left unfiltered, then bucket by minute.
-- Never group by a subset of dims: D6 holds only if summing happens before the max.
-- A zero content_id means "no filter on that dim", via the coalesce/nullIf idiom,
-- verified against 26.7 in DOSSIER_REVIEW Part 2.
--
-- The string dims take a wider sentinel set. Empty string is the canonical "no filter"
-- value and stays exactly as it was, but a model writing SQL against this view by hand
-- reaches for 'ALL' or '*' long before it reaches for '', and a guessed sentinel that is
-- not recognised silently returns zero rows instead of erroring. So every common guess
-- is accepted, case-insensitively and after trimming: '', ALL, ANY, NONE, NULL, * and %.
-- None of them collide with a real value (india, live, vod, the platform names), so the
-- semantics for real values are untouched.
--
-- Real values fall back to a case-insensitive match, but an exact match always wins. A
-- model asked to compare live against vod writes 'LIVE' and 'VOD', which used to match
-- nothing and came back as a confident zero rather than an error. Blanket case folding
-- would be worse: audio_language holds both 'hin' and 'HIN' as distinct slices, and
-- subtitle_language does the same, so folding unconditionally would silently merge two
-- real values and inflate the answer. So the rule is: if the value the caller passed
-- exists exactly, match it exactly; only when it matches nothing at all does the case
-- fold apply, and then only when it would land on exactly one real value. 'hin' stays
-- 1,614, 'HIN' stays its own slice, 'LIVE' still finds live, and a third casing such as
-- 'Hin' that would merge both matches nothing at all rather than reporting 1,899.
--
-- Every one of the ten sort key dimensions is a parameter here, so one view really does
-- answer any filter combination rather than the common four. video_resolution and show_name
-- are filterable on the same terms as the rest, because the dataset documents them as
-- dimensions and a product that cannot filter on them does not match the data it serves.
-- Their values are published exactly as stored: video_resolution holds 1920*1080, 1920 * 1080,
-- Auto-1280*720 and NA as separate slices, and they stay separate. Folding those spellings
-- together would merge real slices and inflate whichever one survived, which is the same
-- reason hin and HIN stay distinct below.
--
-- SQL SECURITY DEFINER: marts_agent is granted SELECT on ${MARTS_DB}.* only, never on
-- clickliv.minute_occupancy directly. Without DEFINER a view runs with the invoker's
-- own privileges, and ClickHouse checks those against the underlying table, which
-- would force granting the raw serving tables too and defeat the whole point of a
-- marts surface. Verified: an invoker-rights view 403s for marts_agent even though
-- the view itself is granted; a DEFINER view does not.
-- The distinct values of every string dimension, materialized once at build time. The
-- case-fold fallback below has to ask "does this value exist exactly", and asking that of
-- minute_occupancy costs a full scan per filtered dimension: eight filters read 871,362
-- rows where none read 96,818, which wipes out the read advantage the whole design is for.
-- Against this table the same test is a few hundred rows. Rebuilt whenever marts is.
