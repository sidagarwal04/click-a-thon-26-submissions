-- minute leads because it is the only predicate the index can use: every marts query
-- carries a minute range, and the dimension filters reach the table wrapped in lower()
-- or as col = col, neither of which KeyCondition can turn into a range. Every dim still
-- appears, so the SummingMergeTree grouping is unchanged and no number moves.
-- video_resolution and show_name join at the tail, after content_id. minute keeps the
-- lead for the reason above, and appending rather than inserting leaves every existing
-- key prefix and every granule boundary where the codec and read-cost measurements
-- found them, so no earlier number has to be re-measured. show_name is functionally
-- determined by content_id, so it adds no groups; video_resolution is a genuine new
-- raw dimension and does add them, but the peak is a max over per-minute sums and the
-- sum still happens before the max, so no published answer moves (D6).
