"""REST endpoints for the dashboard UI. Separate from /v1/chat/completions —
this is plain JSON, no LLM in the loop. Mounted onto the same FastAPI app in
server.py so one uvicorn process serves chat + dashboard + chart images.

Schema is migrations-prod (repo-root migrations-prod/*.sql), not migrationv2:
fact_concurrency_deltas carries platform/country/video_resolution as direct
columns, but NOT video_type/category — those are content-derived and only
reachable via dictGet('dict_content', col, content_id), same as
tools/concurrency.py already does.

fact_concurrency_stats (the pre-grouped per-minute rollup table breakdown
queries would ideally use) is UNRELIABLE on real data: mv_compute_stats's
active_runs/open_runs CTEs default run_end to a 2099-01-01 sentinel for any
session whose close/tombstone event never showed up, and the per-minute
range() explosion on that sentinel either exceeds ClickHouse's 500M-element
array cap or OOMs the query. It has since partially recovered (recent
refreshes are succeeding), but only covers a rolling recent window, not
full history, and can crash again the moment a future refresh hits another
unterminated session — same for the downstream fact_concurrency_stats_hourly
rollup, which reads FROM fact_concurrency_stats FINAL and inherits the same
gap/crash risk. So every breakdown query here (traffic, geo, content
ranking) reads fact_concurrency_deltas directly instead: a plain count() of
delta_sessions=1 rows (session starts) per group, filtered to the window
first — no window function, no per-minute explosion, no dependency on
either fragile table. This reports session *volume* per group, not peak
concurrency per group; only the /concurrency and /kpis curve numbers (which
go through tools/concurrency.py's running-sum) are true concurrency.

All fact_concurrency_deltas reads here use FINAL — confirmed real duplicate
rows on this table (async ReplacingMergeTree dedup from
mv_compute_concurrency's REFRESH...APPEND reprocessing), ~13% overcounted
without it, and FINAL was faster in testing at current row counts. See
tools/concurrency.py's get_concurrency_curve docstring for the measurement."""
