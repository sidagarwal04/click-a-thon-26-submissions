"""SA <= SI invariant check (LLD §8.4/§12.6) — distinguishes a real
system/pipeline issue from an organic concurrency drop.

NOT AVAILABLE under migrations-prod (rohitdevtesting, the current
CH_DATABASE default): that pipeline tracks only a single is_active state,
no separate session-independent presence sketch (cc_delta_dims and
cc_si_minute both don't exist there). Deliberately NOT registered in
agent.py's GENRE_TOOLS/TOOL_SCHEMAS or mcp_server's tool list — the LLM must
never be offered a tool that will hard-fail against the live schema. Kept
here, unused, in case a target DB with those tables (see src/migrations/)
is ever configured again."""
