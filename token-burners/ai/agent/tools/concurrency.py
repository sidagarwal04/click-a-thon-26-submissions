"""LOOKUP + TREND genre tools. Reads fact_concurrency_deltas, whose ORDER BY
is (minute, video_session_id) — time-range-first, so every query here
filters on minute first and treats dims as secondary filters.

migrations-prod (the authoritative schema, see INNER_CONTEXT.md) keeps
fact_concurrency_deltas lean: platform/country/video_resolution are direct
columns, but video_type/category are content-derived and NOT stored on this
table — they're looked up via dictGet('dict_content', ..., content_id) at
query time, same dictionary get_content_metadata reads from.

No narrow cc_delta_dims table exists — every query reads
fact_concurrency_deltas directly, even without a content_id filter. Still
minute-range-bounded either way, just no separate narrow projection for the
no-content-filter case."""

    """Minute/hour/day concurrency curve for a time range + dimension filter.

    FINAL on fact_concurrency_deltas: mv_compute_concurrency is a
    REFRESH...APPEND materialized view, and ReplacingMergeTree's background
    merge/dedup is async — without FINAL, a session recomputed more than
    once (dirty-session reprocessing) shows up as duplicate +1/-1 rows that
    haven't merged away yet, and sum(delta_sessions) double-counts them.
    Confirmed against rohitdevtestingv8: ~13% of rows are such unmerged
    duplicates (406,782 raw vs 352,238 after FINAL over the full history at
    time of writing). FINAL was also faster in that same test, so this
    isn't a tradeoff at current data volumes — revisit if the table grows
    large enough that FINAL's cost starts to dominate.

    ORDER BY minute WITH FILL zero-fills every minute with no delta activity,
    so the running sum is dense at minute resolution (not just the minutes a
    session started or ended in) before any downsampling happens. FROM/TO is
    bound to the same start/end params as the outer filter — safe because
    WITH FILL only adds synthetic gap rows inside that range, it never
    removes the real (unfiltered) rows before `start` that the running sum
    still needs to carry the correct cumulative value into the window (see
    _dim_where_clause docstring — same rule, WITH FILL doesn't change it).

    hour/day grain always computes the full minute-resolution curve first,
    then takes max(concurrency) per hour/day bucket — NOT concurrency at the
    bucket's start instant. That distinction matters a lot for bursty
    traffic: toStartOfDay(minute) as the running-sum's own grouping grain
    reports whatever the value happened to be exactly at midnight, which for
    a short live-content spike is usually ~0 even on a day that peaked at
    18,000+ mid-afternoon — confirmed this exact case against
    rohitdevtestingv8 (day-grain snapshot showed peak=2 for a month that
    genuinely peaked at 18,255). Peak-per-bucket is the correct downsample
    for a concurrency chart; a snapshot-per-bucket silently aliases away
    every spike that isn't still running at the bucket boundary."""
